# Plotting of Figure 1

Files in this directory was used for creating Figure 1 (`Xe-triple.png`) and some additional figures.
In addition to `R-Xe.R` and `parse-Xe.sh`, here, `Xe.wfn` and `gMultiwfn_noGUI` should be (now, these files are empty).
`gMultiwfn_noGUI` must be compiled with included support of fractional derivatives.
Running of `./parse-Xe.sh` should create figures at the end (it may take a time).

`R-Xe.R` requires installation of `tidyr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `RColorBrewer` libraries.
