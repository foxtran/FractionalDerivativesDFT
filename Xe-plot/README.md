# Plotting of Figure 1

Files in this directory was used for creating Figure 1 (`Xe-figR2.png`).
In addition to `R-Xe.R` and `parse-Xe.sh`, here, `Xe.wfn` and `gMultiwfn` should be (now, these files are empty).
`gMultiwfn` must be compiled with included support of fractional derivatives.
Running of `./parse-Xe.sh` should create figures at the end (it may take a time).

`R-Xe.R` requires installation of `tidyr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `RColorBrewer` libraries.
